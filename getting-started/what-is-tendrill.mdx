## Your personal AI wealth manager

**No app required.** Tendrill works entirely through SMS and iMessage — just save the number and start texting.

## What makes Tendrill different

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Proactive monitoring" icon="radar">
    Traditional tools wait for you to check them. Tendrill actively watches your holdings and reaches out when something important happens.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portfolio-aware insights" icon="chart-pie">
    Every alert is personalized to YOUR holdings. If NVIDIA reports earnings and you own the stock, you'll know exactly how it affects your portfolio.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Natural conversations" icon="comments">
    Ask questions in plain English. "How's my tech exposure?" or "What's happening with Apple?" — Tendrill understands and responds naturally.
