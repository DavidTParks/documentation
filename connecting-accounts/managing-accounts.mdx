## Full control over your connections

You're always in control of which accounts Tendrill can access. Add new brokerages, refresh stale connections, or remove accounts entirely — all from your dashboard or via text.

## Adding a new account

Connect additional brokerages to get a complete picture of your investments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Tendrill dashboard">
    Visit [tendrill.ai](https://tendrill.ai) and log in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click '+ Add Account'">
    Find the button in your connected accounts section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for your brokerage">
    Use Plaid to find and connect your institution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the connection">
    Follow the authentication steps for your brokerage
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Or just text:** Message Tendrill "connect another account" and we'll send you a secure link to add a new brokerage.

## Refreshing account data

Your portfolio data syncs automatically, but sometimes you may want to trigger a manual refresh.

### Automatic sync schedule

| Data Type | Refresh Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|
| Holdings & positions | Daily (overnight) |
| Account balances | Daily |
| Transactions | Daily |
| Cost basis updates | Within 24-48 hours of trades |

### Manual refresh options

**Via text:**
```
You: Refresh my portfolio

Tendrill: Refreshing your portfolio data now... 🔄

Done! I've updated your holdings from all connected accounts.
Your current portfolio value: $127,450 (+$890 today)
```

**Via dashboard:**
1. Go to your connected accounts
2. Click the refresh icon (🔄) next to any account
3. Wait for the sync to complete (usually under 1 minute)

<Note>
Some brokerages have rate limits on how often data can be refreshed. If you've recently triggered a refresh, you may need to wait before requesting another.
</Note>

## Removing an account

You can disconnect any account at any time. This immediately revokes Tendrill's access to that account's data.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your dashboard">
    Visit [tendrill.ai](https://tendrill.ai)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the account to remove">
    Locate it in your connected accounts list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Disconnect' or 'Remove'">
    Confirm when prompted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify removal">
    The account will disappear from your portfolio view
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What happens when you disconnect

- **Immediately**: Tendrill loses access to that account's data
- **Within 24 hours**: Historical data for that account is purged from our systems
- **Alerts stop**: You won't receive notifications for holdings in the removed account
- **Plaid access revoked**: The connection is terminated at the Plaid level

<Warning>
**This action is reversible** — you can always reconnect the same account later. But you'll need to go through the authentication process again.
</Warning>

### Alternative: Revoke via Plaid

You can also manage connections through Plaid's consumer portal:

1. Visit [my.plaid.com](https://my.plaid.com)
2. Find Tendrill in your connected apps
3. Click to revoke access

This provides an additional layer of control and lets you see all apps using Plaid with your accounts.

## Reconnecting expired accounts

Connections can expire for several reasons. When this happens, you'll see a notification in your dashboard and receive a text.

### Common reasons for expiration

|--------|-----------|
| Password changed at brokerage | Reconnect with new password |
| Brokerage security update | Re-authenticate through Plaid |
| 90-day re-verification requirement | Log in again to confirm access |
| Failed refresh attempts | Reconnect and verify credentials |

Your dashboard shows the status of each connected account:

| Status | Meaning |

| 🟢 **Connected** | Active and syncing normally |
| 🟡 **Syncing** | Data refresh in progress |
| 🔴 **Needs attention** | Reconnection required |
| ⚪ **Recently added** | Initial data sync in progress |

## FAQ

  <Accordion title="How many accounts can I connect?">
    There's no hard limit. Connect as many brokerages and accounts as you need to get a complete view of your investments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Will removing an account delete my conversation history?">

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I connect the same brokerage twice?">
    If you have multiple logins at the same brokerage (for example, personal and business accounts), you can connect each separately.
