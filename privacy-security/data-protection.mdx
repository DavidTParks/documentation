## Your security is our priority

We understand that connecting your brokerage accounts requires trust. Tendrill is built from the ground up with security and privacy as core principles. Here's how we protect your financial data.

<Info>
**Bank-level security.** Tendrill uses the same security infrastructure trusted by Venmo, Coinbase, and thousands of financial applications.
</Info>

## Plaid: The foundation of secure connections

Tendrill uses Plaid to connect to your brokerage accounts. Plaid is the industry standard for secure financial data connections.

### What is Plaid?

Plaid is a financial technology company that securely connects your bank and brokerage accounts to apps. They've been trusted with:

- **Over 100 million** consumer accounts connected
- **12,000+** financial institutions supported
- **8,000+** apps and services powered

## How the security works

### Credential protection

When you connect your brokerage:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You authenticate directly with your brokerage">
    You enter your credentials into Plaid's secure interface - not Tendrill
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plaid verifies and establishes connection">
    Plaid communicates directly with your brokerage using encrypted channels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tendrill receives only portfolio data">
    We get your holdings and balances - never your username, password, or account numbers
  </Step>
</Steps>

**You** -> *Username/Password (encrypted)* -> **Plaid** -> *Holdings only (no credentials)* -> **Tendrill**

<Check>Tendrill NEVER sees your login credentials</Check>
<Check>All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)</Check>
<Check>All data encrypted at rest (AES-256)</Check>

### Read-only access

Tendrill has **read-only** access to your accounts. This means:

| We CAN | We CANNOT |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ See your holdings and positions | ❌ Execute trades |
| ✅ See your account balances | ❌ Transfer money |
| ✅ See your transaction history | ❌ Change account settings |
| ✅ See cost basis (when available) | ❌ Access other accounts |

<Warning>
**No trade execution capability.** Even if someone compromised Tendrill (which is extremely unlikely given our security), they could not move money or make trades. The connection is technically read-only.
</Warning>

## Data encryption

### In transit

All data moving between systems is encrypted:

- **TLS 1.2+** encryption for all connections
- **Certificate pinning** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Secure WebSocket** connections for real-time data

### At rest

All stored data is encrypted:

- **AES-256** encryption (military grade)
- **Key management** through secure cloud providers
- **Regular rotation** of encryption keys
