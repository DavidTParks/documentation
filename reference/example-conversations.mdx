### Comparing Stocks

<Frame>
```
You: Compare Apple vs Microsoft

Tendrill: 📊 AAPL vs MSFT Head-to-Head

| Metric | AAPL | MSFT |
|--------|------|------|
| Your position | $14,600 | $19,800 |
| % of portfolio | 11.1% | 15.1% |
| Market cap | $2.9T | $3.1T |
| P/E ratio | 29x | 35x |
| Revenue growth | 3% | 12% |
| Dividend yield | 0.5% | 0.7% |
| YTD return | +18% | +42% |

APPLE — THE HARDWARE GIANT
✅ iPhone dominance, Services growth
✅ Massive buybacks, loyal customer base
✅ Strong brand, premium pricing
⚠️ Dependent on iPhone (50%+ revenue)
⚠️ Slower growth than big tech peers

MICROSOFT — THE CLOUD LEADER
✅ Azure cloud growing 28%
✅ AI integration (Copilot, OpenAI)
✅ Diversified: Cloud, Office, Gaming
⚠️ Higher valuation
⚠️ Regulatory scrutiny on acquisitions

YOUR PORTFOLIO
You own more MSFT by value, and it's outperforming
this year. Both are core tech holdings — reasonable
to own both for different exposure.

## Portfolio Analysis

### Allocation Check

<Frame>
```
You: Am I too concentrated in anything?

Tendrill: 🔍 Concentration Analysis

⚠️ POSITION CONCENTRATION
• NVDA: 34% of portfolio — HIGH
  Rule of thumb: No single stock >10%
  Your NVDA is 3x typical guidelines

• Top 3 stocks: 60% of portfolio
  NVDA + MSFT + AAPL dominate your returns

⚠️ SECTOR CONCENTRATION
• Technology: 65%
  S&P 500 is ~30% tech
  You're making a big bet on tech

✅ WHAT'S WORKING
• Your concentration in NVDA has paid off massively
• Tech outperformance drove your returns

⚠️ THE RISK
• If NVDA drops 20%, portfolio drops ~7%
• If tech corrects, limited protection
• All your "winners" are correlated

NOT ADVICE, BUT CONTEXT:
Some investors would trim NVDA to lock in gains
and diversify. Others let winners run. It depends
on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Performance Review

<Frame>
```
You: How have I done this year?

Tendrill: 📊 2024 Year-to-Date Performance

YOUR PORTFOLIO
• Start of year: $98,500
• Current: $131,200
• Gain: +$32,700 (+33.2%)

BENCHMARK COMPARISON
• S&P 500: +18.5%
• Nasdaq: +28.2%
• You: +33.2%

🏆 You beat both benchmarks!

TOP CONTRIBUTORS
1. NVDA: +$24,500 (75% of total gain)
2. MSFT: +$5,400
3. AAPL: +$2,800

TOP DETRACTOR
1. TSLA: -$1,200 (only loser)

INSIGHT:
Your outperformance is almost entirely NVDA.
Without it, you'd be roughly matching the S&P.
This isn't bad — it means you made a great pick.
But be aware of how concentrated that bet is.

## Learning Conversations

### Understanding a Concept

<Frame>
```
You: What's P/E ratio in simple terms?

Tendrill: Great question! 📚

P/E RATIO = Price ÷ Earnings

In plain English:
"How much are investors paying for each dollar 
of profit this company makes?"

EXAMPLE:
• AAPL stock price: $182
• AAPL earnings per share: $6.30
• P/E ratio: 182 ÷ 6.30 = 29x

This means investors pay $29 for every $1 of 
Apple's profit.

WHAT IT TELLS YOU:

High P/E (30+):
• Investors expect strong growth
• "Premium" valuation
• Example: NVDA at 65x

Low P/E (under 15):
• Slower growth expected
• "Value" stock
• Example: Banks often 10-12x

Average market P/E: ~20-22x

YOUR PORTFOLIO P/E RATIOS:
• NVDA: 65x (very high — growth priced in)
• AAPL: 29x (moderate premium)
• MSFT: 35x (premium for growth)
• TSLA: 75x (extremely high)

### What-If Scenarios

<Frame>
```
You: What if the market drops 20%?

Tendrill: 📉 Bear Market Scenario Analysis

IF THE S&P 500 DROPPED 20%:

Your portfolio estimated impact:
• Current value: $131,200
• Estimated new value: ~$105,000
• Estimated loss: ~$26,200 (-20%)

WHY "ESTIMATED"?
Different stocks drop differently in corrections:

LIKELY TO DROP MORE THAN 20%:
• NVDA (high growth, high P/E): Maybe -30%
• TSLA (volatile, high P/E): Maybe -35%

LIKELY TO DROP LESS THAN 20%:
• VOO (diversified): Close to -20%
• JNJ (defensive): Maybe -12%

YOUR SPECIFIC RISK:
Because 65% of your portfolio is tech, and tech
typically drops more in corrections, you might 
see -25% to -30% in a 20% market decline.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
• 2022 bear market: S&P -25%, Nasdaq -33%
• 2020 COVID crash: -34% (recovered in 5 months)
• 2008 financial crisis: -57% (recovered in 4 years)

SILVER LINING:
Every historical bear market has been followed
by a recovery. The question is time and your
ability to hold through volatility.
