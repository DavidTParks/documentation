  <Card title="Credentials never touch Tendrill" icon="key">
    You log in directly with your brokerage through Plaid's secure interface. Your username and password are never shared with or stored by Tendrill.
  </Card>
  <Card title="End-to-end encryption" icon="lock">
    All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ and at rest using AES-256 encryption — the same standards used by banks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Read-only access" icon="eye">
    Tendrill can only view your holdings and positions. We cannot move money, execute trades, or modify your account in any way.
  </Card>
  <Card title="You're always in control" icon="toggle-on">
    You can disconnect your accounts at any time, instantly revoking Tendrill's access to your data.

  <Step title="Enter your brokerage credentials">
    Log in with your brokerage username and password. This information goes directly to your brokerage through Plaid — Tendrill never sees it.
    
    <Warning>

    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete two-factor authentication (if required)">
    If your brokerage uses 2FA, you'll be prompted to complete that step. This might include:
    - Entering a code sent to your phone
    - Approving a push notification
    - Using an authenticator app
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select accounts to connect">

    <Tip>
    Connect all investment accounts for the most complete portfolio view. Tendrill works best when it can see your entire picture.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review permissions and confirm">
    Review what data Tendrill will access, then confirm the connection.
    
    **Data Tendrill receives:**
    - Account balances and holdings
    - Stock symbols and quantities
    - Cost basis (when available)
    - Transaction history (for performance tracking)
    
    **Data Tendrill does NOT receive:**
    - Your login credentials
    - Account numbers
    - Ability to make trades or transfers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens after connecting

Once your connection is established:

1. **Initial sync begins** — Tendrill pulls your current holdings and positions
2. **Portfolio model created** — We analyze your allocation, sector exposure, and key events
3. **Monitoring starts** — You'll begin receiving proactive alerts for your holdings
4. **Confirmation text sent** — You'll get a message confirming your account is connected

## Understanding permissions

When you connect via Plaid, you grant specific permissions:

| Permission | What It Means | Why Tendrill Needs It |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Account info** | Basic account details | To identify and organize your accounts |
| **Balances** | Current account values | To calculate portfolio performance |
| **Holdings** | Stock positions and quantities | To monitor and analyze your investments |
| **Transactions** | Buy/sell history | To track cost basis and returns |

<Note>
**Read-only means read-only.** Plaid's connection type for Tendrill is strictly read-only. There is no technical capability for Tendrill to execute trades, move money, or modify your account.
</Note>

- **SOC 2 Type II certified** — Regular third-party security audits
- **GDPR and CCPA compliant** — Strong privacy protections
- **Data minimization** — Only collects what's necessary
- **Consumer rights** — You can request data deletion at any time

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is it safe to enter my brokerage password?">
    Yes. You enter your credentials directly into Plaid's secure interface, not Tendrill. Plaid uses the same security infrastructure as major banks and has connected over 100 million accounts safely.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can Tendrill see my account numbers or Social Security Number?">
    No. Tendrill only receives holdings, balances, and transaction data. We do not have access to account numbers, routing numbers, or personal identification information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my brokerage credentials change?">
    If you update your password at your brokerage, you may need to reconnect. You'll receive a notification if your connection needs to be refreshed. See [Managing Connected Accounts](/connecting-accounts/managing-accounts).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I revoke access?">
    Absolutely. You can disconnect any account at any time from your Tendrill dashboard. You can also revoke access through [Plaid's consumer portal](https://my.plaid.com).
