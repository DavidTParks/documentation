## Serve your clients better

As a wealth manager, you're juggling multiple client portfolios with different risk profiles, investment goals, and attention requirements. Tendrill helps you stay on top of everything - alerts across all accounts, quick client-ready insights, and the ability to proactively reach out before clients call you.

<Info>
**Know before your clients ask.** When a holding moves significantly, you'll hear about it first - so you can reach out proactively, not reactively.

## Setting up for wealth management

### Multi-account monitoring

Connect all client accounts you manage. Tendrill aggregates everything while keeping accounts separate:

```
You: I manage 12 client portfolios. How do I set this up?

Tendrill: Perfect for wealth managers! Here's how it works:

1. Connect each client account via Plaid
   (You can name them: "Smith IRA", "Johnson Family", etc.)

2. I'll monitor ALL connected accounts for:
   • Price movements in any holding
   • Earnings for any owned stock
   • News affecting any position

3. Alerts will specify which client is affected:
   "AAPL down 5% - affects: Smith, Johnson, Davis accounts"

4. Ask about any client specifically:
   "How's the Smith portfolio doing?"

Ready to connect your first client account?
```

### Alert configuration for multiple clients

```
You: Alert me if any client's stock drops 5%

Tendrill: ✅ Cross-portfolio alert enabled!

I'll text you when ANY holding across your 12 client 
portfolios drops 5% or more in a day.

Alert format:
"[ALERT] TSLA -6.2% - Affects: Johnson ($8,400), 
Davis ($12,100), Patel ($5,200)"

You'll see the affected clients and their exposure sizes
so you can prioritize outreach.
```

> | Henderson Family Trust | $125,000 | 8% | -$8,750 |
> | Martinez Retirement | $45,000 | 12% | -$3,150 |
> | Chen Growth Account | $78,000 | 15% | -$5,460 |
> | Williams IRA | $22,000 | 6% | -$1,540 |

> **Cause:** Concerns about China export restrictions on AI chips.
>
> **Suggested talking point:** "Regulatory concerns are common for NVDA. Fundamentals remain strong with 100%+ data center growth."
>
> Want a client-ready summary for any of these accounts?
