## Step-by-step connection guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Connect Account' in your dashboard">
    From your Tendrill dashboard or during onboarding, click the button to add a new brokerage connection.
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search for your brokerage">
    Plaid's interface will appear. Search for your brokerage by name or browse popular institutions.
    
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter your brokerage credentials">
    Log in with your brokerage username and password. This information goes directly to your brokerage through Plaid - Tendrill never sees it.
    
    <Warning>
    **Security tip:** Only enter your credentials when you see Plaid's verified interface. Look for the Plaid branding and secure connection indicator.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete two-factor authentication (if required)">
    If your brokerage uses 2FA, you'll be prompted to complete that step. This might include:
    - Entering a code sent to your phone
    - Approving a push notification
    - Using an authenticator app
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select accounts to connect">
    Choose which accounts you want to link with Tendrill. You can select individual accounts or connect all of them.
    
    
    <Tip>
    Connect all investment accounts for the most complete portfolio view. Tendrill works best when it can see your entire picture.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review permissions and confirm">
    Review what data Tendrill will access, then confirm the connection.
    
    **Data Tendrill receives:**
    - Account balances and holdings
    - Stock symbols and quantities
    - Cost basis (when available)
    - Transaction history (for performance tracking)
    
    **Data Tendrill does NOT receive:**
    - Your login credentials
    - Account numbers
    - Ability to make trades or transfers
  </Step>
</Steps>
