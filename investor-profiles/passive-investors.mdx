## Investing without the anxiety

You've built a solid portfolio. Maybe it's a mix of index funds and a few individual stocks. You're in it for the long haul — you don't want to check your accounts every day, but you also don't want to miss something important.

Tendrill is perfect for you. Set it up once, and let it watch your portfolio so you can live your life.

<Info>
**The passive investor's motto:** "Time in the market beats timing the market." Tendrill helps you stay informed without the temptation to over-trade.

## Recommended setup for passive investors

### Step 1: Connect all your accounts

Link every investment account — brokerage, IRA, 401(k). Tendrill works best with the complete picture.

### Step 2: Set up weekly recaps

```
You: Send me a weekly portfolio summary every Sunday evening

Tendrill: ✅ Weekly recap scheduled for Sundays at 6:00 PM ET!
```

This gives you a regular check-in without daily noise.

### Step 3: Enable monthly reviews

```
You: Monthly performance report on the 1st

Tendrill: ✅ Monthly review scheduled for the 1st of each month!
```

Monthly reviews help you track long-term progress and spot allocation drift.

### Step 4: Set high-threshold alerts

```
You: Only alert me if any stock drops more than 10% in a day

Tendrill: ✅ High-threshold alert set!

I'll only text you about daily moves greater than 10%.
For your portfolio, this means you'll likely hear from me 
a few times per year, not per week.
```

## The passive investor advantage

Research consistently shows that:

- **Lower fees** = better long-term returns
- **Less trading** = lower taxes and costs
- **Time in market** = compound growth

Tendrill supports this philosophy by:

1. **Not encouraging unnecessary trades** — We inform, we don't suggest
2. **Reducing anxiety** — You know you'll hear about important events
3. **Providing context** — When you do check in, you get the full picture
4. **Keeping you invested** — Fewer panic sells during market dips

## What Tendrill filters out for you

When you're set up for passive investing, Tendrill automatically reduces noise:

| What You WON'T Hear About | Why |
|--------------------------|-----|
| Daily 1-2% moves | Normal market volatility |
| Every analyst opinion | Doesn't change long-term thesis |
| Short-term news | Usually noise, not signal |
| What others are buying/selling | Irrelevant to your strategy |

| What You WILL Hear About | Why |
|-------------------------|-----|
| Major earnings misses/beats | Could affect position thesis |
| Significant dividend changes | Impacts income strategy |
| Large position moves (10%+) | Worth knowing about |
| Monthly/quarterly performance | Track your progress |

## FAQ for passive investors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I be tempted to trade more if I use Tendrill?">
    Tendrill is designed to inform, not encourage trading. We don't send "hot tips" or suggest trades. Most passive investors find they're *less* anxious because they know they'll be alerted if something important happens.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I don't want to hear anything except emergencies?">
    Set all your alert thresholds high (15-20% moves), enable monthly reviews only, and tell Tendrill "minimal alerts please." You'll only hear about major events.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I connect my 401(k)?">
    Yes! Even if you can't actively manage it, knowing your full portfolio picture helps with overall allocation decisions.
