## Data freshness explained

Tendrill uses different data sources with different update frequencies. Understanding this helps you interpret the information you receive and know when to expect updates.

## Data sources and timing

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Source |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Stock prices** | Real-time (during market hours) | Market data providers |
| **Portfolio holdings** | Daily (overnight sync) | Plaid connection |
| **News & events** | Continuous (24/7) | Multiple news sources |
| **Earnings data** | As released | Company filings, news |
| **Analyst ratings** | As released | Research providers |
| **SEC filings** | As filed | SEC EDGAR |

## Real-time data

### Stock prices

During market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET), Tendrill uses real-time stock prices:

- **Alerts**: Price movement alerts use live data
- **Questions**: "What's AAPL trading at?" gives you the current price
- **Impact calculations**: Your position value updates continuously

<Info>
**Extended hours:** Pre-market (4:00-9:30 AM) and after-hours (4:00-8:00 PM) pricing is available but may be less reliable due to lower volume.
</Info>

### News and events

News monitoring runs 24/7:

- Breaking news is processed within minutes
- Earnings results are analyzed immediately after release
- Overnight news is captured for morning briefings

## Delayed/daily data

### Portfolio holdings (via Plaid)

Your holdings data syncs from your brokerage accounts daily:

| Action | When It Appears in Tendrill |
|--------|----------------------------|
| You buy a stock at 10 AM | Next day after overnight sync |
| You sell a stock | Next day after overnight sync |
| Dividend is paid | 1-2 days after payment |
| Stock split | Usually same-day or next day |

<Note>
**Manual refresh:** Text "refresh my portfolio" to trigger an on-demand sync. This may pull more recent data, but some brokerages still have delays.
</Note>

### Cost basis and transactions

Transaction history and cost basis update daily:

- Recent trades appear in your transaction list
- Cost basis calculations update after trades settle (T+1 or T+2)
- Dividend reinvestments show after processing

## How this affects your experience

### Scenario: You buy a stock

```
10:00 AM - You buy 10 shares of AAPL in your Robinhood app

10:05 AM - You ask Tendrill "What do I own?"
Tendrill shows your portfolio WITHOUT the new AAPL shares
(The data hasn't synced yet)

Next morning - Data syncs overnight
Now Tendrill shows the AAPL shares and starts monitoring them
```

### Scenario: Intraday price alerts

```
9:30 AM - Market opens, NVDA at $890

11:00 AM - NVDA drops to $845 (-5%)
Tendrill immediately texts you: "NVDA down 5%..."

The alert uses real-time price data, not the
daily synced data.
```

### Scenario: Evening question

```
6:00 PM - You text "How did I do today?"

Tendrill responds with:
- Real-time closing prices (from 4 PM close)
- Your share counts (from last overnight sync)
- Calculated gains/losses (prices × shares)
```

## Data timing indicators

Tendrill tells you when data might be stale:

> **Your Portfolio**
>
> Total: $131,200 (as of 4:00 PM ET)
> Holdings synced: Today 5:30 AM
>
> *Note: Any trades made today will appear after tonight's sync.*

## Why isn't everything real-time?

### Brokerage limitations

Brokerages don't provide instant APIs for all data:

- Most brokerages update Plaid connections daily, not continuously
- Some data (cost basis, transactions) has processing delays
- This is an industry-wide limitation, not specific to Tendrill

### What we optimize

Given these constraints, Tendrill prioritizes:

1. **Real-time prices** - What matters most for alerts
2. **Fast news** - Breaking information that affects decisions
3. **Accurate holdings** - Daily sync ensures completeness

## Interpreting data in alerts

When you see portfolio impact numbers:

```
"NVDA up 5% - Your position: +$2,225"
```

This calculation uses:
- **Price change**: Real-time (accurate to the minute)
- **Share count**: From last sync (may be up to 24 hours old)
- **Impact**: Real-time price × synced shares

<Warning>
If you traded that stock today, the impact calculation may be off until the next sync. The price is correct; the share count may be outdated.
</Warning>

## Manual refresh options

### Force a portfolio sync

```
You: Refresh my portfolio

Tendrill: Refreshing now... 🔄

Done! Your portfolio data has been updated.
• Last sync: Just now
• Holdings: 15 positions
• Total value: $131,450

Note: Some brokerages have delays even with 
manual refresh. If recent trades don't appear,
they should show up by tomorrow.
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does Tendrill show different values than my brokerage?">
    Common reasons:
    1. **Timing**: Your brokerage may show real-time; Tendrill uses last sync for shares
    2. **Price source**: Slight differences in quote timing

    Differences are usually small and resolve after the next sync.
