## News that matters to YOU

Financial news is everywhere, but most of it doesn't affect your portfolio. Tendrill filters thousands of sources to surface only the news relevant to your holdings, and explains what it means for you specifically.

>
> **Bottom line:** Positive news for shareholders like you. No action needed.

### Macro event

> **Tendrill** - Wed 2:15 PM
>
> **Fed Holds Rates Steady**

>
> **Market reaction:**

> - Nasdaq: +1.1%
> - 10-year Treasury yield: Down to 4.2%

>
> **NVDA Price Target Raised**
>
> **What happened:** Goldman Sachs raised their NVIDIA price target from $900 to $1,100, maintaining their "Buy" rating.
>
> **Their reasoning:**
> - AI demand "unprecedented and accelerating"
> - Blackwell chip cycle to drive growth
> - Data center revenue could exceed $100B
>
> **Context:** This is the 5th price target raise for NVDA this month. The average analyst target is now $1,050 (vs current $890).
>
> **Your position:** You own 50 shares worth $44,500. At Goldman's $1,100 target, your position would be worth $55,000 (+$10,500).
>
> Note: Analyst targets aren't predictions - they're opinions on fair value.
