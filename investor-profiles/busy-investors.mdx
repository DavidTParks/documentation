Tendrill gives you the executive summary of your portfolio, delivered when it's convenient for you.

## FAQ for busy investors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have time to respond to alerts?">
    No response needed! Tendrill alerts are informational. There's no action required unless you decide to act. Most messages are "FYI" not "do something now."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can Tendrill manage my portfolio for me?">
    No - Tendrill provides information, not management. But for busy people, that's often enough. Knowing what's happening lets you make occasional informed decisions without daily research.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the quickest way to check my portfolio?">
    Just text "quick update" - you'll get a one-line response with your portfolio value and today's change.
