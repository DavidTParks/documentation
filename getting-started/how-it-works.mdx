## The Tendrill experience in 3 steps

Tendrill is designed to be effortlessly simple. Here's how it works from start to finish:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your brokerage accounts">
    Link your investment accounts securely through Plaid. Tendrill builds a real-time model of your holdings across all your brokerages — stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and more.
    
    <Tip>You can connect multiple accounts from different brokerages. Tendrill aggregates everything into a single, unified view of your portfolio.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tendrill monitors everything">
    Once connected, Tendrill continuously watches your portfolio for important events:
    - **Earnings announcements** from companies you own
    - **Significant price movements** in your holdings
    - **Breaking news** that affects your positions
    - **Macro signals** like Fed decisions and economic data
    
    Everything is filtered for relevance to YOUR portfolio — no generic market noise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive insights via text">
    When something important happens, Tendrill sends you a clear, actionable text message. You can also text Tendrill anytime with questions about your portfolio.
    
    All communication happens through SMS or iMessage — no app to download, no dashboard to check.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens behind the scenes

### 1. Secure connection via Plaid

When you connect your brokerage, Tendrill uses Plaid — the same secure infrastructure used by Venmo, Coinbase, and thousands of financial apps. Here's what happens:

- You authenticate directly with your brokerage (Tendrill never sees your password)
- Plaid establishes a read-only connection to your account
- Only your holdings and positions are shared — we can't move money or make trades

<Info>
**Read-only access only.** Tendrill can see your holdings but cannot execute trades, transfer funds, or modify your account in any way.
</Info>

### 2. Portfolio model creation

Once connected, Tendrill builds a comprehensive model of your portfolio:

| Data Point | What We Track | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Holdings** | Symbols, quantities, cost basis | Understand your positions |
| **Allocation** | Sector weights, diversification | Identify concentration risk |
| **Performance** | Gains/losses, daily changes | Track how you're doing |
| **Events** | Earnings dates, ex-dividend dates | Know what's coming |

### 3. Continuous monitoring

Tendrill's AI continuously scans for events relevant to your portfolio:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Intelligent filtering

Not every piece of news deserves your attention. Tendrill uses AI to:

- **Assess relevance** — Does this affect companies you own?
- **Calculate impact** — How much does this move the needle on your portfolio?
- **Determine urgency** — Is this something you need to know now?
- **Generate insights** — What does this mean for you specifically?

### 5. Personalized delivery

When something passes the relevance threshold, Tendrill crafts a personalized message:
