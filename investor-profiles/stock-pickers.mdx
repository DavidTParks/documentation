## Stock picker conversations

### Pre-earnings analysis

```
You: Tell me everything about NVDA's upcoming earnings

Tendrill: 📊 NVDA Earnings Preview (reporting Nov 20)

Expectations:
• EPS: $0.74 (vs $0.40 last year) +85%
• Revenue: $32.5B (vs $18.1B last year) +80%
• Data Center: $28B expected (the key metric)

What Wall Street is watching:
1. Data center demand sustainability
2. China export impact from new restrictions
3. Blackwell chip production ramp
4. Gross margin trajectory

Historical earnings reactions:
• Last 4 quarters: +8%, +14%, -3%, +24%
• Average move: ±10%
• Options implying: ±8.5% this time

Your position:
• 50 shares worth $44,500 (34% of portfolio)
• At implied move, you're looking at ±$3,780

Sentiment:
• 42 analysts: 38 Buy, 4 Hold, 0 Sell
• Average price target: $1,050 (vs $890 current)

The risk: Any weakness in data center growth or 
margin compression could trigger sharp selling.

### Risk assessment

```
You: What are the biggest risks in my portfolio?

Tendrill: 🔍 Portfolio Risk Assessment

CONCENTRATION RISK (High):
• NVDA is 34% of your portfolio
• Your top 3 stocks = 62% of assets
• Tech overall = 75% exposure

If NVDA dropped 20%, your portfolio would drop 6.8%

SINGLE-STOCK RISKS:

NVDA (34% of portfolio):
• Valuation: P/E of 65x prices in a lot of growth
• Competition: AMD, Intel, custom chips emerging
• Geopolitical: China export restrictions

TSLA (8% of portfolio):
• Margin pressure from price cuts
• Execution risk on Cybertruck, Semi
• Musk distraction risk

PLTR (6% of portfolio):
• Customer concentration (government heavy)
• Stock-based compensation dilution
• Profitability sustainability

MACRO RISKS:
• Rising rates hurt growth stocks (your focus)
• 75% tech means you're correlated to Nasdaq
• Limited international diversification

RECOMMENDATIONS (not advice):
• Consider position sizing on NVDA
• You have no bond or defensive exposure
• Sector diversification could reduce volatility
