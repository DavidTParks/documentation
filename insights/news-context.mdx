## News that matters to YOU

Financial news is everywhere, but most of it doesn't affect your portfolio. Tendrill filters thousands of sources to surface only the news relevant to your holdings, and explains what it means for you specifically.

## How Tendrill processes news

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    Tendrill continuously scans thousands of sources: financial news outlets, SEC filings, press releases, analyst reports, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter">
    AI identifies news mentioning companies you own or sectors you're exposed to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assess materiality">
    Not every mention matters. Tendrill evaluates: Is this significant enough to potentially move the stock?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contextualize">
    For news that passes the filter, Tendrill explains what it means for YOUR specific position and portfolio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deliver">
    You receive a clear, actionable summary via text — not a raw news dump.
  </Step>

│                                             │
│ What happened:                              │
│ Apple announced a $110 billion stock       │
│ buyback program — the largest in corporate │
│ history.                                    │
│                                             │
│ What this means:                            │
│ Buybacks reduce shares outstanding, which  │
│ typically boosts earnings per share and    │
│ can support stock prices. It signals that  │
│ Apple's management believes the stock is   │
│ undervalued and wants to return cash to    │
│ shareholders.                               │
│                                             │
