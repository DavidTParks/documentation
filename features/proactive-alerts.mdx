## Tendrill watches so you don't have to

Instead of constantly checking apps or scanning headlines, Tendrill proactively monitors your holdings and reaches out when something important happens. You'll always know what's moving the needle on your portfolio.

<Info>
**Personalized, not generic.** Every alert is filtered through your portfolio. You won't hear about Apple earnings unless you own Apple.
</Info>

## Customizing your alerts

### Set specific price alerts

```
You: Alert me if Apple drops below $170

Tendrill: Got it! I'll text you if AAPL drops below $170.

You currently have 80 shares at an average cost of $165.
A drop to $170 would mean your position is up $400 (+2.9%).
```

### Adjust alert frequency

```
You: I'm getting too many alerts

Tendrill: I can dial it back. Would you prefer:

1. Major events only (earnings, big moves of 5%+)
2. Daily summary instead of real-time
3. Specific stocks only

Just let me know what works best for you.
```

### Turn off specific alerts

```
You: Stop alerting me about Tesla

Tendrill: Done. I won't send proactive alerts about TSLA anymore.

You'll still see Tesla in your portfolio summaries, and you can 
always ask me questions about it. Just say "resume TSLA alerts" 
to turn them back on.
```
