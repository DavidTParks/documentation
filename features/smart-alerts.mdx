## Alerts tailored to you

While Tendrill automatically monitors your portfolio, you can also set up custom alerts for specific conditions you care about. Whether it's a price target, news about a particular stock, or a regular check-in, Smart Alerts keep you informed on your terms.

<Info>
**Set it and forget it.** Create an alert once, and Tendrill will monitor 24/7 until your condition is met.

## Setting up price alerts

### Basic price alert

Simply tell Tendrill the condition you want to monitor:

```
You: Alert me if Apple drops below $170

Tendrill: ✅ Alert set!

I'll text you when AAPL falls below $170.
Current price: $182.50 (7.4% above your alert)

Your AAPL position: 80 shares
At $170, your position would be worth $13,600
(currently $14,600)
```

### Multiple price levels

```
You: Set alerts for NVDA at $800 and $950

Tendrill: ✅ Two alerts set for NVDA:

1. Alert if NVDA drops to $800 (currently $890)
   • Trigger: 10.1% below current price
   
2. Alert if NVDA rises to $950 (currently $890)
   • Trigger: 6.7% above current price

I'll text you when either level is hit.
Want to add any other price levels?
```

### Price alert examples

| What You Say | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Alert me if TSLA hits $300" | Notified when TSLA reaches $300 (up or down) |

| "Let me know if MSFT goes above $400" | Notified only if MSFT rises above $400 |
| "Ping me at GOOGL $180" | Notified when GOOGL reaches $180 |

## Percentage change alerts

### Daily movement alerts

Get notified when a stock moves significantly in a single day:

```
You: Alert me if any of my stocks drop 5% in a day

Tendrill: ✅ Portfolio-wide alert set!

I'll text you if any of your 12 holdings drops 5% or 
more in a single trading day.

Based on historical volatility:
• NVDA, TSLA: May trigger occasionally (volatile)
• AAPL, MSFT: Rare (typically stable)
• VOO: Very rare (diversified ETF)
```

### Stock-specific movement alerts

```
You: Alert me if Tesla moves 3% today

Tendrill: ✅ Intraday alert set for TSLA!

I'll text you if TSLA moves up or down by 3% or more 
today. Currently at $248.50.

• Alert triggers above: $255.96
• Alert triggers below: $241.05

This alert expires at market close (4:00 PM ET).
```

## News and event alerts

I'll text you when there's significant news about 
Microsoft, including:
• Earnings and financial updates

You'll only get material news - I filter out the noise.
```

Your NVDA position: 50 shares worth $44,500
```

>
> Apple dropped below $170. Current price: $168.45

## Smart alert suggestions

Tendrill may proactively suggest alerts based on your portfolio:

> **Tendrill** - Thu 9:15 AM
>
> **Alert suggestion**
>
> Your NVDA position is up 85% and is now 34% of your portfolio.
>
> Want me to alert you if NVDA drops 10% from here? That would protect against giving back $4,450 of your gains.
>
> Reply "yes" to set this alert, or "no thanks" to dismiss.
