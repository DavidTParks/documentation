### Portfolio overview questions

```
You: How's my portfolio doing?

Tendrill: Your portfolio is up $2,340 (+1.8%) today!

Current value: $131,200

Today's movers:
📈 NVDA: +$890 (+2.1%)
📈 AAPL: +$620 (+1.4%)
📈 MSFT: +$480 (+1.2%)
📉 TSLA: -$120 (-0.5%)

Your tech-heavy allocation (65%) is driving gains today 
as the Nasdaq outperforms. Want more details on any position?
```

### Specific stock questions

```
You: What's happening with Apple?

Tendrill: AAPL is at $182.50, up 1.4% today.

Your position: 80 shares worth $14,600
Your gain: +$2,400 (+19.7%) since purchase

```

### Deep research queries

```
You: Should I be worried about my Tesla position?

Tendrill: Let me break down the current TSLA picture for you.

Your exposure: 25 shares ($6,200) = 4.7% of portfolio

🟡 Mixed signals right now:

Concerns:
• EV competition intensifying (BYD, legacy automakers)
• Margin pressure from price cuts
• Robotaxi timeline uncertain

Positives:
• Energy storage business growing 100%+ YoY
• FSD improvements accelerating
• Strong brand and manufacturing scale

Analyst view: 18 Buy, 12 Hold, 8 Sell
Average price target: $265 (current: $248)

Your position is a relatively small part of your portfolio,
which limits downside risk. Want me to compare TSLA's 
risk profile to your other holdings?

## Conversation examples

### Morning check-in

<Frame>
```
You: Good morning! What should I know today?

Tendrill: Good morning! ☀️ Here's your daily brief:

📊 Your portfolio: $131,200 (no change pre-market)

🗓️ Today's events:
• JPM and WFC report earnings before open
• You don't own these, but they set the tone for financials

📰 Overnight news:
• China GDP came in slightly below expectations
• Your international exposure is minimal (3%)

📈 Futures:
• S&P 500: +0.3%

### Investment research

<Frame>
```
You: I'm thinking about buying Google. What should I know?

Tendrill: Great choice to research! Here's the GOOGL overview:

📊 Current price: $178.25
📈 YTD performance: +52%
💰 Market cap: $2.2 trillion

The bull case:
• AI integration across Search, Cloud, YouTube
• Cloud revenue growing 28% YoY
• Strong advertising moat
• $118B cash on balance sheet

The bear case:
• Regulatory scrutiny (DOJ antitrust case)
• AI search disruption concerns
• YouTube ad growth slowing

Valuation:
• P/E: 24x (vs 5-year avg of 26x)
• Looks reasonable for the growth

How it would fit YOUR portfolio:
• You're already 65% tech
• Adding GOOGL would increase that to 68%
• Consider if you want more tech concentration

Want me to compare it to your existing holdings?
```

### Understanding a concept

<Frame>
```
You: What's the difference between a stock split and a dividend?

Tendrill: Great question! They're quite different:

📊 Stock Split:
• Company divides existing shares into more shares
• Example: 2-for-1 split doubles your shares, halves the price
• Your total value stays EXACTLY the same
• It's like exchanging a $20 bill for two $10s
• Companies do this to make shares more accessible

💵 Dividend:
• Company pays you cash from its profits
• Example: $0.50/share quarterly = $2/year per share
• This is NEW money in your pocket
• You can reinvest it or spend it
• Not all companies pay dividends (growth stocks often don't)

In your portfolio:
• AAPL pays dividends ($0.96/year = 0.5% yield)
• NVDA recently did a 10-for-1 split
• TSLA and AMZN don't pay dividends

Want me to explain dividend yield or show your dividend income?

Tendrill: NVDA reports earnings on Nov 20th after market close.

Analyst expectations:

[Tendrill knows you're still talking about NVIDIA]
```

### Portfolio-aware comparisons

```
You: Compare my top 3 holdings

Tendrill: Here's how your biggest positions stack up:

| Metric      | AAPL    | NVDA    | MSFT    |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Your value  | $14,600 | $44,500 | $19,800 |
| % of port   | 11.1%   | 33.9%   | 15.1%   |
| YTD return  | +18%    | +190%   | +42%    |
| P/E ratio   | 29x     | 65x     | 35x     |
| Div yield   | 0.5%    | 0.03%   | 0.7%    |

Observations:
• NVDA is your largest position by far
• It's also your best performer but most expensive
• AAPL and MSFT offer more dividend income
• Consider if 34% in one stock is comfortable for you
```

### Hypothetical scenarios

```
You: What if NVDA dropped 20%?

Tendrill: If NVDA dropped 20% from here ($890 → $712):

Your NVDA position:
• Current: $44,500
• After 20% drop: $35,600
• Loss: -$8,900

Portfolio impact:
• Current total: $131,200
• After drop: $122,300
• Total loss: -$8,900 (-6.8% of portfolio)

For context:
• NVDA dropped 20% twice last year
• Both times it recovered within 3 months
• Your position size means NVDA moves your portfolio significantly
