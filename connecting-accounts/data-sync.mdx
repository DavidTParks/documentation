- **Share quantities** - How many shares of each position
- **Account balances** - Total value of each account
- **Cost basis** - Your purchase price (when available from brokerage)
- **Recent transactions** - Buys and sells from the past 30 days

</Note>

## Market data (real-time)

While portfolio holdings sync daily, Tendrill uses real-time market data for:

### Live stock prices

- **During market hours** (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET): Real-time quotes
- **Pre-market & after-hours**: Extended hours pricing where available
- **Weekends & holidays**: Last closing price

### News monitoring

Tendrill continuously scans thousands of sources for news about your holdings:

| Source Type | Examples | Check Frequency |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Financial news | Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC | Real-time |
| Company announcements | Press releases, SEC filings | Real-time |
| Analyst reports | Upgrades, downgrades, price targets | As released |
| Social sentiment | Major discussions and trends | Hourly |

### Earnings & events calendar

Tendrill maintains an up-to-date calendar of:
- Earnings report dates
- Ex-dividend dates
- Stock split announcements
- Fed meetings and economic releases

## Understanding data freshness in alerts

When Tendrill sends you an alert, here's what data it's using:

> **Tendrill** - Today 10:30 AM
>
> $NVDA is up 4.2% this morning after strong AI chip demand forecasts.
>
> - Your position: 50 shares *(from last sync)*
> - Current price: $892.45 *(real-time)*
> - Your gain today: +$1,870 *(calculated live)*
>
> I'll let you know if it moves significantly from here.

## Handling data discrepancies

Sometimes you might notice small differences between Tendrill and your brokerage:

### Common causes

| Discrepancy | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Different share count | Recent trade not yet synced | Wait for next sync or manual refresh |
| Value doesn't match | Price timing differences | Tendrill may use a different quote time |
| Missing position | New purchase | Will appear after overnight sync |
| Extra position | Recent sale | Will update after overnight sync |

### When to be concerned

<Warning>
Contact support if you notice:
- Holdings missing for more than 48 hours after purchase
- Significant value discrepancies that persist after refresh
- Positions showing that you've never owned
</Warning>

## Cost basis data

Cost basis (your original purchase price) is important for calculating gains and losses:

| Scenario | Cost Basis Availability |
|----------|------------------------|
| Stocks purchased at current brokerage | Usually available |
| Transferred positions | May not transfer with cost basis |
| Older purchases | Depends on brokerage records |
| Inherited securities | Often shows as $0 cost basis |

<Tip>
If your cost basis is missing or incorrect, your gain/loss calculations may be off. You can often update cost basis directly with your brokerage.
</Tip>

## Data retention

Tendrill's approach to your data:

- **Active data**: Kept as long as your account is connected
- **After disconnection**: Deleted within 24 hours
- **Conversation history**: Retained separately (not tied to portfolio data)
- **No third-party sharing**: Your data is never sold or shared
