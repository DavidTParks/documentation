No app to download. No complex setup. Just connect your accounts and start texting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up with your phone number">
    Visit [tendrill.ai](https://tendrill.ai) and enter your phone number. You'll receive a verification code via text to confirm your number.
    
    
    <Tip>Use the phone number where you want to receive alerts. This will be your primary way of communicating with Tendrill.</Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect your brokerage accounts">
    After verification, you'll be prompted to link your investment accounts through Plaid. This secure connection gives Tendrill read-only access to your holdings.
    
    **To connect an account:**
    1. Click "Connect Account"
    2. Search for your brokerage (Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood, etc.)
    3. Log in with your brokerage credentials
    4. Select which accounts to link

    - "When are my next earnings?"
