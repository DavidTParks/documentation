## You're always in control

Whether you want to disconnect one account, remove all connections, or delete your entire Tendrill account, the process is straightforward. Here's how to manage your data.

## Options available

| Action | What It Does | Your Data |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Disconnect one account** | Removes one brokerage | That account's data deleted |
| **Disconnect all accounts** | Removes all brokerages | All portfolio data deleted |
| **Delete Tendrill account** | Removes everything | Complete data deletion |

## Disconnecting a single account

If you want to remove one brokerage but keep using Tendrill:

### Via dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to tendrill.ai and log in">
    Navigate to your account settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Connected Accounts">
    Click on the account you want to remove
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Disconnect'">
    Confirm when prompted
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via text

```
You: Disconnect my Fidelity account

Tendrill: Are you sure you want to disconnect your Fidelity 
account? I'll stop monitoring those holdings.

Type "yes" to confirm.

You: yes

Tendrill: ✅ Fidelity account disconnected.

• Holdings from that account: Removed
• Alerts for those positions: Cancelled
• Your other accounts: Still connected

You can reconnect anytime.
```

### What happens next

- **Immediately**: Tendrill loses access to that account
- **Within 24 hours**: All data from that account is deleted
- **Alerts**: Any alerts for stocks only in that account are cancelled
- **Other accounts**: Unaffected

## Disconnecting all accounts

To remove all brokerage connections while keeping your Tendrill account:

```
You: Disconnect all my accounts

Tendrill: This will disconnect all 3 of your brokerage 
accounts:
• Fidelity Individual
• Vanguard IRA
• Robinhood

I'll stop monitoring your portfolio and delete all 
holdings data. Your Tendrill account will remain 
active for future use.

Type "disconnect all" to confirm.

You: disconnect all

Tendrill: ✅ All accounts disconnected.

• All holdings data: Deleted
• All alerts: Cancelled
• Your account: Still active

You can reconnect accounts anytime by texting 
"connect account" or visiting tendrill.ai.
```

## Deleting your Tendrill account

For complete account deletion:

### Via text

```
You: Delete my account

Tendrill: ⚠️ Account deletion request

This will permanently delete:
• Your Tendrill account
• All connected brokerage accounts
• All conversation history
• All preferences and alerts

This cannot be undone.

To confirm, type "delete my account permanently"

You: delete my account permanently

Tendrill: ✅ Account deletion initiated.

• All connections: Terminated
• All data: Queued for deletion
• Timeline: Completed within 24 hours

Thank you for trying Tendrill. If you ever want to 
return, you're always welcome. 👋

monitoring continues as normal. How can I help?
