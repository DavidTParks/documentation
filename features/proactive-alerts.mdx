## Tendrill watches so you don't have to

Instead of constantly checking apps or scanning headlines, Tendrill proactively monitors your holdings and reaches out when something important happens. You'll always know what's moving the needle on your portfolio.

<Info>
**Personalized, not generic.** Every alert is filtered through your portfolio. You won't hear about Apple earnings unless you own Apple.

## Earnings alerts

Earnings season can be overwhelming, but Tendrill keeps it simple.

### Pre-earnings notification

A few days before a company you own reports earnings, you'll get a heads-up:

> **Tendrill** - Mon 9:00 AM
>
> Earnings heads up! NVDA reports after market close on Wed.
>
> **Your position:** 50 shares ($44,500)
>
> Analyst expectations:
> - EPS: $5.57 (vs $4.02 last year)
> - Revenue: $28.5B (+112% YoY)
>
> The stock typically moves +/-8% on earnings. Want me to explain what to watch for?

### Post-earnings results

After the report is out, you'll get an instant breakdown:

> **Tendrill** - Wed 4:15 PM
>
> NVDA earnings are in - they crushed it!
>
> **Results vs. expectations:**
> - EPS: $6.12 (beat by 10%)
> - Revenue: $35.1B (beat by 23%)
> - Data Center: $30.8B (+112% YoY)
>
> The stock is up 8% after hours.
>
> **Your position impact:** +$3,560 (+8.0%) if this holds tomorrow
>
> Key takeaway: AI demand accelerating faster than expected. Guidance raised. Want the full breakdown?

## Price movement alerts

Not every 1% move needs your attention. Tendrill identifies significant movements based on:

- Historical volatility of the stock
- Size of your position
- Overall market conditions
- News context (if any)

### Example price alert

> **Tendrill** - Tue 11:30 AM
>
> TSLA is down 7% today
>
> **What's happening:** Reports of Model Y production pause in Shanghai due to supply chain issues.
>
> **Your exposure:**
> - 25 shares worth $6,200
> - Down $465 (-7.0%) today
> - 4.9% of your portfolio
>
> **Context:** This appears to be a short-term production issue, not a demand problem. Analyst consensus remains bullish.
>
> Should I keep you posted on developments?

### Alert thresholds

Tendrill automatically adjusts alert sensitivity based on volatility:

| Stock Type | Typical Alert Threshold |
|------------|------------------------|
| Large-cap stable (AAPL, JNJ) | ±3% daily move |
| Growth stocks (NVDA, TSLA) | ±5% daily move |
| Small-cap / volatile | ±7% daily move |
| Based on your position size | Larger positions = lower threshold |

<Tip>
You can customize these thresholds. Text "alert me if AAPL drops 2%" to set a specific level.
</Tip>

>

>
> This is generally positive for shareholders like you.

## Portfolio impact calculations

Every alert includes how the event affects YOUR portfolio specifically.

### What "+$6,600 (+3.4%)" means

When you see portfolio impact numbers:

| Component | What It Represents |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Dollar amount** | Change in your position's value |
| **Percentage** | Change relative to your position's previous value |
| **Portfolio weight** | How much of your total portfolio is affected |

**Example:** Alert says "$NVDA is up 5% after earnings"

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Position | 50 shares of NVDA |
| Previous value | $44,500 |
| Current value | $46,725 |
| **Change** | **+$2,225 (+5.0%)** |
| Portfolio weight | 35% of your portfolio |
| Portfolio impact | The 5% gain in NVDA = 1.75% portfolio gain |

## Customizing your alerts

### Set specific price alerts

```
You: Alert me if Apple drops below $170

Tendrill: Got it! I'll text you if AAPL drops below $170.

You currently have 80 shares at an average cost of $165.
A drop to $170 would mean your position is up $400 (+2.9%).
```

### Adjust alert frequency

```
You: I'm getting too many alerts

Tendrill: I can dial it back. Would you prefer:

1. Major events only (earnings, big moves of 5%+)
2. Daily summary instead of real-time
3. Specific stocks only

Just let me know what works best for you.
```

### Turn off specific alerts

```
You: Stop alerting me about Tesla

Tendrill: Done. I won't send proactive alerts about TSLA anymore.

You'll still see Tesla in your portfolio summaries, and you can 
always ask me questions about it. Just say "resume TSLA alerts" 
to turn them back on.
```
