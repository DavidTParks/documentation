## What happens behind the scenes

### 1. Secure connection via Plaid

When you connect your brokerage, Tendrill uses Plaid - the same secure infrastructure used by Venmo, Coinbase, and thousands of financial apps. Here's what happens:

- You authenticate directly with your brokerage (Tendrill never sees your password)
- Plaid establishes a read-only connection to your account
- Only your holdings and positions are shared - we can't move money or make trades

<Info>
**Read-only access only.** Tendrill can see your holdings but cannot execute trades, transfer funds, or modify your account in any way.
</Info>

### 2. Portfolio model creation

Once connected, Tendrill builds a comprehensive model of your portfolio:

| Data Point | What We Track | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Holdings** | Symbols, quantities, cost basis | Understand your positions |
| **Allocation** | Sector weights, diversification | Identify concentration risk |
| **Performance** | Gains/losses, daily changes | Track how you're doing |
| **Events** | Earnings dates, ex-dividend dates | Know what's coming |

### 3. Continuous monitoring

Tendrill's AI continuously scans for events relevant to your portfolio:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Intelligent filtering

Not every piece of news deserves your attention. Tendrill uses AI to:

- **Assess relevance** - Does this affect companies you own?
- **Calculate impact** - How much does this move the needle on your portfolio?
- **Determine urgency** - Is this something you need to know now?
- **Generate insights** - What does this mean for you specifically?

### 5. Personalized delivery

When something passes the relevance threshold, Tendrill crafts a personalized message:

> **Tendrill** - Today 2:15 PM
>
> Heads up: The Fed just held rates steady at 5.25-5.50%, as expected.
>
> **Your portfolio impact:**
> - Tech holdings (+1.2%): +$890
> - REITs (+0.8%): +$340
> - Total: +$1,230 since announcement
>
> Rate-sensitive stocks typically benefit from rate pause signals. Your REIT exposure may see continued strength.

## Data freshness

| Data Type | Update Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|
| Portfolio holdings | Synced daily (or on-demand refresh) |
| Stock prices | Real-time during market hours |
| News & events | Continuous monitoring |
| Earnings data | Updated as reports are released |

<Note>
Brokerage data refreshes may take up to 24 hours depending on your institution. You can manually trigger a refresh anytime by texting "refresh my portfolio" to Tendrill.
