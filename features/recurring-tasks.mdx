    Set updates for when you actually have time to read them — commute, lunch, evening
  </Card>
  <Card title="Start simple" icon="seedling">
    Begin with weekly recaps before adding daily. See what fits your style.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time zone aware" icon="clock">
    Tendrill uses your registered time zone. Update in settings if needed.

## Investor profile recommendations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Passive investors" icon="couch">
    **Recommended:** Weekly recap on Sundays + Monthly review
    
    You don't need daily updates. Weekly keeps you informed without noise.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Busy professionals" icon="briefcase">
    **Recommended:** Daily brief at your preferred time
    
    One quick update helps you stay informed during hectic weeks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Active traders" icon="chart-line">
    **Recommended:** Daily brief before market + End of day recap

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What time zone are updates based on?">
    Updates are sent based on the time zone you registered with. Market-related times (like "before market open") are always in Eastern Time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get updates on weekends?">
    Yes! Weekend updates summarize the week and preview the upcoming week. Markets are closed, so there's no live data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I miss an update?">
    Updates aren't stored for later delivery. If you miss one, just ask "give me my daily brief" or "weekly recap" for an on-demand version.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do recurring tasks count against my message limit?">
    On the free tier, recurring task messages count toward your monthly limit. Premium users have unlimited messages.
