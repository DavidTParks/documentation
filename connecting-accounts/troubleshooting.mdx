## Common issues and solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My brokerage doesn't appear in search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Try these steps:**
    
    1. **Use different search terms** — Try "Schwab" instead of "Charles Schwab", or "Merrill" instead of "Merrill Lynch"
    2. **Check for parent companies** — Some brokerages appear under their parent (e.g., TD Ameritrade may be under Charles Schwab after the merger)
    3. **Search by website URL** — Try searching for your brokerage's login website
    4. **Check our [supported list](/getting-started/supported-brokerages)** — Confirm your institution is in our supported list
    
    <Info>
    If your brokerage truly isn't supported, [contact us](mailto:support@tendrill.ai) to request it.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Invalid credentials' error" icon="key">
    **This usually means:**
    - Your username or password was entered incorrectly
    - Your brokerage password recently changed
    - You're using credentials for a different account
    
    **Try these steps:**
    
    1. **Log in directly at your brokerage's website** — Confirm your credentials work there first
    2. **Check for typos** — Usernames and passwords are case-sensitive
    3. **Try the 'forgot password' flow** at your brokerage if needed
    4. **Look for special characters** — Some passwords with symbols may need careful entry
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Two-factor authentication problems" icon="mobile">
    **If you're not receiving your 2FA code:**
    
    1. **Check the right device** — Codes may go to a phone number or email you don't check often
    2. **Wait a moment** — SMS codes can be delayed by a few minutes
    3. **Check spam/junk folders** — Email codes sometimes get filtered
    4. **Try an alternate 2FA method** — Many brokerages offer backup options
    
    **If your authenticator app isn't working:**
    
    1. **Verify the time on your device** — Authenticator apps are time-sensitive
    2. **Use backup codes** — Most brokerages provide backup codes during 2FA setup
    3. **Contact your brokerage** — They can help reset 2FA if needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Additional verification required'" icon="shield">
    **This means your brokerage wants extra confirmation:**
    
    1. **Check your email and phone** — Your brokerage may have sent a verification request
    2. **Log in directly to your brokerage** — Sometimes you need to approve a new connection from their website
    3. **Answer security questions** — Plaid may ask you to answer questions your brokerage has on file
    4. **Wait 24 hours** — Some security holds lift automatically
    
    <Warning>
    Never share security question answers or passwords with anyone claiming to be from Tendrill. We will never ask for this information directly.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection worked, but data is missing" icon="database">
    **If some accounts or holdings aren't showing:**
    
    1. **Wait for full sync** — Initial data can take up to 24 hours to fully populate
    2. **Check account selection** — You may have unchecked some accounts during connection
    3. **Trigger a manual refresh** — Text "refresh my portfolio" to Tendrill
    4. **Reconnect the account** — Sometimes a fresh connection resolves data issues
    
    **Data that may not sync:**
    - Pending transactions
    - Some alternative investments
    - Certain restricted account types (like some 529s)
    - Holdings in foreign currencies
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Connection expired' or 'Please reconnect'" icon="clock">
    **Why this happens:**
    
    Connections can expire when:
    - You change your brokerage password
    - Your brokerage updates their security systems
    - It's been a long time since initial authentication
    - Your brokerage requires periodic re-verification
    
    **To fix:**
    
    1. Go to your Tendrill dashboard
    2. Find the affected account
    3. Click "Reconnect" or "Refresh connection"
    4. Log in again with your current credentials
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="'Institution temporarily unavailable'" icon="building-columns">
    **This means the brokerage is experiencing issues:**
    
    - **Wait and retry** — Most outages resolve within a few hours
    - **Check your brokerage directly** — They may have posted about scheduled maintenance
    - **Try during off-peak hours** — Early morning or late evening often work better
    
    <Note>
    Plaid maintains connections with thousands of institutions. Occasional temporary outages are normal and usually brief.
    </Note>
