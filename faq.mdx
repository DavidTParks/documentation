## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Tendrill?" icon="sparkles">
    Tendrill is an AI-powered personal wealth manager that monitors your investment portfolio and delivers proactive insights via text message. Connect your brokerage accounts, and Tendrill will watch for earnings, price movements, and news that affect your holdings — then text you when something important happens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Tendrill a financial advisor?" icon="user-tie">
    **No.** Tendrill provides information and analysis, but we do not provide personalized investment advice or recommendations. We don't tell you to buy or sell anything. We're an information service that helps you stay informed about your investments.
    
    For personalized investment advice, please consult a licensed financial advisor or registered investment professional.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Tendrill different from my brokerage's alerts?" icon="bell">
    Most brokerage alerts are basic ("AAPL is up 5%") and require manual setup for each stock. Tendrill is different:
    
    - **Portfolio-aware**: Calculates impact on YOUR holdings, not just raw percentages
    - **Proactive**: Automatically monitors everything you own
    - **Contextual**: Explains WHY something is happening
    - **Conversational**: Ask follow-up questions in natural language
    - **Multi-brokerage**: Aggregates across all your accounts
    
    It's the difference between a basic notification and a knowledgeable assistant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Tendrill different from ChatGPT or other AI chatbots?" icon="robot">
    Generic AI chatbots don't know your portfolio. Tendrill:
    
    - **Connects to your accounts**: Knows exactly what you own
    - **Monitors continuously**: Doesn't require you to ask
    - **Proactive alerts**: Reaches out when things happen
    - **Financial data integration**: Real-time prices, news, earnings
    
    ChatGPT can answer general questions. Tendrill answers questions about YOUR investments and proactively keeps you informed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to download an app?" icon="mobile">
    **No!** Tendrill works entirely through SMS and iMessage. Just save Tendrill's number and text like you would text anyone else. No app to download, no dashboard to check (though we have one if you want it).

</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my financial data safe?" icon="shield-check">
    Yes. Tendrill uses Plaid — the same secure infrastructure used by Venmo, Coinbase, and thousands of financial apps. Your brokerage credentials are never stored by Tendrill (you authenticate directly with your brokerage through Plaid). All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using bank-level encryption.
    
    [Learn more about our security practices](/privacy-security/data-protection)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Tendrill access my brokerage password?" icon="key">
    **No.** You log in directly with your brokerage through Plaid's secure interface. Your username and password are never shared with or stored by Tendrill. We only receive your holdings and positions — never your credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can Tendrill make trades or move my money?" icon="ban">
    **No.** Tendrill has read-only access to your accounts. We can see your holdings but cannot execute trades, transfer funds, or modify your account in any way. This is a technical limitation of our Plaid connection, not just a policy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you sell or share my financial data?" icon="hand">
    **Never.** We don't sell your data to advertisers, share it with partners, or monetize it in any way. Our business model is subscriptions, not data sales.
    
    [See our full commitments](/privacy-security/never-does)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I delete my data?" icon="trash">
    You can disconnect individual accounts or delete your entire Tendrill account at any time:
    - Text "disconnect [account name]" to remove one account
    - Text "delete my account" for complete deletion
    - Or manage from your dashboard
    
    Data is deleted within 24 hours. [Full instructions](/privacy-security/disconnecting)

## Data & Accuracy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often does my portfolio data update?" icon="rotate">

    [Full details on data timing](/insights/data-timing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does Tendrill show different values than my brokerage?" icon="calculator">
    Small differences are normal due to:
    - Quote timing (different sources, different seconds)

    If you see large discrepancies, try texting "refresh my portfolio" or check that your accounts are still connected.

    Yes! Tendrill can research any publicly traded stock. Ask questions like:
