## Clear commitments you can trust

We believe transparency means being explicit about what we will never do with your data. These aren't just policies - they're promises.

<Info>
**These commitments are non-negotiable.** If any of these ever changed, we would notify you in advance and give you the choice to leave with your data deleted.
</Info>

## We NEVER sell your data

<Card title="No data sales. Ever." icon="ban" color="#dc2626">
Your financial data is never sold, rented, licensed, or traded to:
- Advertisers
- Data brokers
- Marketing companies
- Financial institutions
- Research firms
- Anyone else

We make money from subscriptions, not your data.
</Card>

## We NEVER share your portfolio

Your holdings, positions, and financial information are never shared with:

| Entity | Shared? | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Advertisers | ❌ Never | We don't run ads |
| Partners | ❌ Never | No data partnerships |
| Affiliates | ❌ Never | We have none |
| Your brokerage | ❌ Never | Information flows one way |

## We NEVER store your passwords

    Your brokerage username and password never touch Tendrill's servers. You authenticate directly with your brokerage through Plaid's secure interface.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No way to access accounts" icon="lock">
    Even if someone compromised Tendrill (extremely unlikely), they could not log in to your brokerage. We don't have your credentials.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## We NEVER make trades or move money

Tendrill has **read-only access** to your accounts. This is a technical limitation, not just a policy.

**We cannot:**
- Buy or sell securities
- Transfer funds
- Change your account settings
- Open or close positions
- Modify any aspect of your account

Even if you asked us to, we couldn't. The Plaid connection doesn't allow it.

## We NEVER give financial advice

<Warning>
**Tendrill is not a financial advisor.** We provide information and analysis, but we:
- Never tell you to buy or sell
- Never recommend specific investments
- Never manage your money
- Never provide personalized investment advice

All investment decisions are yours. For personalized advice, consult a licensed financial professional.
</Warning>

## We NEVER show you ads

Tendrill is ad-free. You will never see:

- Sponsored content
- Promoted stocks
- Affiliate recommendations
- Banner ads
- Native advertising
- "Suggested" investments

Our business model is simple: you pay for a service. We're not selling your attention to advertisers.

## We NEVER use your data to train AI

Your personal portfolio data is never used to:

- Train machine learning models
- Improve AI algorithms
- Create financial products
- Develop trading strategies

Any aggregate analysis we do is:
- Fully anonymized
- Impossible to trace back to you
- Used only to improve the Tendrill service

## We NEVER contact you without reason

You will only receive texts from Tendrill when:

- An alert you set is triggered
- A scheduled update you requested arrives
- Something significant happens to your portfolio
- You ask us a question

We never text you:
- Marketing messages
- Promotional offers
- "Tips" or unsolicited advice
- Third-party advertisements

## We NEVER make it hard to leave

You can delete your account and data at any time:

- No "are you sure?" loops
- No waiting periods
- No hidden fees
- No retention tricks
- No dark patterns

Text "delete my account" and confirm. Done.

## We NEVER hide our practices

Our privacy and security policies are:

- Written in plain English
- Available publicly
- Updated transparently
- Consistent with our actions

If you ever have questions about how we handle your data, ask. We'll answer honestly.
