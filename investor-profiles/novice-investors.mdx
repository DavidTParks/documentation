## Getting started as a new investor

### Step 1: Connect your accounts

Even if you only have one account with a few holdings, connect it! Tendrill works with any portfolio size.

### Step 2: Ask Tendrill to explain your portfolio

```
You: Can you explain what I actually own?

Tendrill: Of course! Let me break down your portfolio:

You own 4 investments worth $8,500 total:

1. VOO ($3,000) - Vanguard S&P 500 ETF
   This is like owning tiny pieces of 500 large US companies
   (Apple, Microsoft, etc.) all in one purchase. Great for
   beginners - instant diversification!

2. AAPL ($2,500) - Apple Inc.
   You own shares of Apple, the iPhone/Mac company. When
   Apple does well, your shares go up in value.

3. MSFT ($2,000) - Microsoft Corporation
   Shares of Microsoft. They make Windows, Office, Xbox,
   and cloud computing services.

4. VTI ($1,000) - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF
   Like VOO but includes smaller companies too. Very
   diversified, very beginner-friendly.

Overall: You have a solid starter portfolio! VOO and VTI
give you broad market exposure, and AAPL + MSFT are two
of the most successful companies ever.

### Step 3: Set up gentle updates

Tendrill: ✅ Beginner-friendly weekly update set!

Every Sunday at 6pm, you'll get:
• Your portfolio value and weekly change
• Simple explanation of what happened
• Any news in plain English
• No confusing jargon, promise!

I'll also include a "learn something new" tip each week.

## Sample beginner conversation

<Frame>
```
You: Why did my Apple stock go down $200 today? Should I be worried?

Tendrill: Great question - let me help you understand!

First, the facts:
• Your AAPL dropped $200 (8% of your $2,500 position)
• The whole stock market went down today, not just Apple
• Nothing is "wrong" with Apple specifically

Why this happens:
Markets go up AND down. It's completely normal. Today,
investors were worried about inflation news, so many people
sold stocks - including Apple.

Should you worry? 🤔
Probably not! Here's why:
• Short-term drops are normal (happens many times per year)
• Apple is still the same company it was yesterday
• Over time, markets have historically recovered
• You haven't actually "lost" money until you sell

What most experts suggest:
If you don't need this money soon, don't panic. Companies
like Apple have survived many market dips and gone on to
new highs.

💡 Learning tip: This is called "volatility" - short-term
price swings that are a normal part of investing.

## Sample weekly update for beginners

> **Tendrill** - Sun 6:00 PM
>
> **Your Friendly Weekly Update!**
>
> Your portfolio: $8,500
> This week: +$150 (+1.8%)
>
> **In plain English:** Good week! The stock market went up, and your investments went up with it. Your portfolio grew by $150 - that's like finding money in your couch, but better!
>
> **What happened:**
> - Apple went up because iPhone sales are strong
> - Microsoft went up on good cloud news
> - Your ETFs (VOO, VTI) followed the market
>
> **Learn something new:** "Compounding" is when your gains start making their own gains. Your $150 gain will now grow too - it's like a snowball rolling downhill!
>
> Keep it up! Time in the market is your biggest advantage.

## Common new investor worries

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My stocks went down - did I lose money?">
    Not unless you sell! If you own Apple at $180 and it drops to $170, you still own the same shares. The price on screen is only what you'd get IF you sold today. If Apple goes back up (and it often does), your "loss" disappears.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Is now a good time to invest?">
    Historically, time IN the market beats timING the market. Waiting for the "perfect moment" often means missing out. Many experts suggest consistent investing over time rather than trying to predict ups and downs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="My portfolio is small - does it even matter?">
    Absolutely! Small amounts invested early can grow significantly over time thanks to compounding. Starting with $100/month at age 25 can grow more than $500/month starting at 45.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I don't understand something Tendrill said">
    Just ask! Say "what does that mean?" or "explain that simpler please." Tendrill will break it down further. There's no shame in asking - that's how everyone learns.
